<p>I created and teach the course <a href="https://agilesoftwarecourse.org">CSCI E-71/S-71 Agile Software Development</a>. The purpose of the course is to make sure all CS graduates have real-world skills to build and deliver great software products that people love.</p>
<p>Students love the course. In the most recent semester (Fall 2021), students rated the course 4.8 out of 5.0, significantly higher than the mean course review. Sample student reviews include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>This is one of the best hands-on courses to learn agile software development. You learn the theory and practice it in a safe environment. This is a &ldquo;DO NOT MISS THIS&rdquo; course</em></li>
<li><em>This is a great class which includes very helpful, real life examples and talks about real strategies for implementing agile and tackling challenges associated with it. Richard is a great professor with immense knowledge. His style of teaching is wonderful. I loved the class structure. The breakout room activities really help us learn the agile concepts. The final project that we do was a great learning experience as we had to implement agile framework ground up and teaching staff helped us in our way. This is a must course for learning agile practices. A fun course as well.</em></li>
