<p>(See description above.)</p>
<h3>Agile Coach/Manager, Senior Software Engineering Manager &ndash; Nokia &ndash; 2010-2013</h3>
<p>I coached teams on Agile software development, and I led the software dev team for Nokia Account, one of the world&rsquo;s largest social identity systems. </p>
<p>I was an Agile coach/manager. As a manager, I had formal responsibility and authority. I had skin in the game, so I had strong motivation to lead my team to success. But I wasn&rsquo;t a traditional manager, a dictator using command-and-control to coerce and intimidate. I managed in the style of a coach, creating physical, mental, and emotional space within which my team succeeded, guiding them and giving them the skills they needed to win. I did this using Agile principles and practices. I used Agile not because it&rsquo;s in fashion, but because when it&rsquo;s used rigorously, teams can&rsquo;t help but succeed. </p>
<p>I led the software dev team for one of the world&rsquo;s largest social identity systems, coached Agile software teams around the world, and was the founder and leader of Nokia&rsquo;s Boston-area Agile community. I contributed to the larger Agile community in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Director of Solutions and Services, Manager of Engineering Program Management &ndash; Nellymoser &ndash; 2006-2010</h3>
<p>We built remarkable mobile applications, with a focus on video and music services, for companies like CBS Sports, Audible, AT&amp;T, Virgin Mobile, and Viacom. I worked directly with our customers to make sure we mutually understood and met their goals. I ran the engineering team that built these customized mobile apps, using Scrum and other Agile practices to lead our projects and continually improve our capabilities. I also ran the IT and Operations group, making sure our hosted services stayed up and running. Our apps ran on a wide variety of mobile phones, and we used technologies like Java ME/SE/EE, BREW, WAP, MySQL, and Linux.</p>
<h3>Software Team Lead, Principal Software Engineer, Sales Engineer &ndash; CentrePath &ndash; 2003-2006</h3>
<p>We built Magellan DataPath Manager, a network management application focused on storage and long-haul optical networks, using SNMP, TL1, command line interfaces, and proprietary APIs to monitor the network hardware. I led the software team, mentoring and managing the other software developers while making my own individual contributions to the tool&rsquo;s design and implementation. I also worked as a sales engineer, demoing the product to prospects and customers and at trade shows. I made frequent site visits to help sell, install, and configure our application. I gave technical presentations to prospective customers, OEMs, and development partners, and I was the technical person of choice for presentations to potential acquirers, with audiences that ranged from individual contributors to senior VPs of Fortune 500 companies. We built the product using Java SE 5.0, C++, JESS, and Oracle.</p>
<h3>Consultant, Founder &ndash; Altisimo Computing &ndash; 1997-2004</h3>
<p>I worked as a consultant and contractor, helping numerous organizations achieve their technology goals. In 2003 and 2004, we refocused on mobile apps. We wrote how to articles for publication, developed a Java ME training course, and presented at conferences, user groups, and training classes. We founded Boston Mobile, the Boston-area community of mobile software developers. </p>
<p>As a solo consultant, I did it all, including marketing, sales, and delivery. My clients included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Martha Birnbaum Consulting: I prototyped a web-based data collection system for a federally funded research project.

<li>Altisimo Cycling: I conceived, built, and deployed a web-based training log to help competitive cyclists track their training activities. I used JAWS, a Hibernate-like tool for object-relational mapping, and EJB 2.0 container managed persistence of entity beans in JBoss. I used a session bean as a facade over the business layer, and I built a JSP-based MVC framework for the GUI. </li>
<li>GaleGroup: I trained staff members on JavaSE and EE, JUnit, servlets, JSP, and EJB. I also designed and implemented tools to help test Gale Group&rsquo;s search-and-delivery system for documents in their publishing catalog, using Java EE, XML, JAXP, EJB, JBoss, and WebLogic. </li>

I implemented PianoPlay.app using Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and S3.</p>
<h3>Creator &ndash; VaccinateAll.org &ndash; 2021-present</h3>
<p><a href="https://VaccinateAll.org">VaccinateAll.org</a> is a website and social media presence that encourages English and Spanish speakers around the world to vaccinate themselves and their loved ones against Covid. It spreads positive messages to fight against rampant mis- and disinformation. Future iterations of VaccinateAll will generalize the message to promote vaccinations against other preventable infirmities. I publish in Spanish to ensure that the large non-English-speaking community of Spanish speakers receives all the information they need to make informed decisions to vaccinate themselves.</p>
