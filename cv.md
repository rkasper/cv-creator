## Teaching and Training
### Instructor -- Harvard University -- 2015-present
I created and teach the course [CSCI E-71/S-71 Agile Software Development](https://agilesoftwarecourse.org). The purpose of the course is to make sure all CS graduates have real-world skills to build and deliver great software products that people love.

Students love the course. In the most recent semester (Fall 2021), students rated the course 4.8 out of 5.0, significantly higher than the mean course review. Sample student reviews include:

* *This is one of the best hands-on courses to learn agile software development. You learn the theory and practice it in a safe environment. This is a "DO NOT MISS THIS" course.*
* *This is a great class which includes very helpful, real life examples and talks about real strategies for implementing agile and tackling challenges associated with it. Richard is a great professor with immense knowledge. His style of teaching is wonderful. I loved the class structure. The breakout room activities really help us learn the agile concepts. The final project that we do was a great learning experience as we had to implement agile framework ground up and teaching staff helped us in our way. This is a must course for learning agile practices. A fun course as well.*

I hire and manage my own teaching assistants. To ensure all students feel welcome and can succeed in the course, my teaching assistants are typically women and people of color.

The course itself is an immersive experience in Agile software development. We study the technical, business innovation, and people-dynamics aspects of Agile, including:

* Agility in software product development
* Technical agility, including:
    * Pair programming
    * Mob programming
    * Test-driven development
    * Working with legacy code: refactoring for clean code
    * Behavior-driven development
    * Continuous integration
    * Continuous delivery
    * DevOps
* Business agility, including:
    * Scrum
    * Agile product inception
    * User stories and product backlog construction
    * Definition of done and definition of ready
    * Estimating

## Corporate Experience
### Teacher, Coach, Consultant, Keynote Speaker, Author -- Richard Kasperowski | With Great People -- 2013-present
(See description above.)

### Agile Coach/Manager, Senior Software Engineering Manager -- Nokia -- 2010-2013
I coached teams on Agile software development, and I led the software dev team for Nokia Account, one of the world's largest social identity systems. 

I was an Agile coach/manager. As a manager, I had formal responsibility and authority. I had skin in the game, so I had strong motivation to lead my team to success. But I wasn't a traditional manager, a dictator using command-and-control to coerce and intimidate. I managed in the style of a coach, creating physical, mental, and emotional space within which my team succeeded, guiding them and giving them the skills they needed to win. I did this using Agile principles and practices. I used Agile not because it's in fashion, but because when it's used rigorously, teams can't help but succeed. 

I led the software dev team for one of the world's largest social identity systems, coached Agile software teams around the world, and was the founder and leader of Nokia's Boston-area Agile community. I contributed to the larger Agile community in the United States and elsewhere.

### Director of Solutions and Services, Manager of Engineering Program Management -- Nellymoser -- 2006-2010
We built remarkable mobile applications, with a focus on video and music services, for companies like CBS Sports, Audible, AT&T, Virgin Mobile, and Viacom. I worked directly with our customers to make sure we mutually understood and met their goals. I ran the engineering team that built these customized mobile apps, using Scrum and other Agile practices to lead our projects and continually improve our capabilities. I also ran the IT and Operations group, making sure our hosted services stayed up and running. Our apps ran on a wide variety of mobile phones, and we used technologies like Java ME/SE/EE, BREW, WAP, MySQL, and Linux.

### Software Team Lead, Principal Software Engineer, Sales Engineer -- CentrePath -- 2003-2006
We built Magellan DataPath Manager, a network management application focused on storage and long-haul optical networks, using SNMP, TL1, command line interfaces, and proprietary APIs to monitor the network hardware. I led the software team, mentoring and managing the other software developers while making my own individual contributions to the tool's design and implementation. I also worked as a sales engineer, demoing the product to prospects and customers and at trade shows. I made frequent site visits to help sell, install, and configure our application. I gave technical presentations to prospective customers, OEMs, and development partners, and I was the technical person of choice for presentations to potential acquirers, with audiences that ranged from individual contributors to senior VPs of Fortune 500 companies. We built the product using Java SE 5.0, C++, JESS, and Oracle.

### Consultant, Founder -- Altisimo Computing -- 1997-2004
I worked as a consultant and contractor, helping numerous organizations achieve their technology goals. In 2003 and 2004, we refocused on mobile apps. We wrote how to articles for publication, developed a Java ME training course, and presented at conferences, user groups, and training classes. We founded Boston Mobile, the Boston-area community of mobile software developers. 

As a solo consultant, I did it all, including marketing, sales, and delivery. My clients included: 

* Martha Birnbaum Consulting: I prototyped a web-based data collection system for a federally funded research project. The project, Composition Corrector, investigated and attempted to correct the grammatical errors in the writing of nonnative speakers. We used Java, JSP, SQL, JBoss, and HSQLDB. 
* SmartWorlds: I ported iShop from Flash on Pocket PC over Wi-Fi to J2ME on mobile phones over the cellular data network. iShop is a handheld application the brings the Amazon.com experience to your mobile device. 
* Slick Willy Bike Lube: I designed and built the credit card processing part of Slick Willy's website using Java EE, including JSP. 
* Sandia National Laboratories: I made custom enhancements to CQuest, a unique thesaurus-based database engine and image database. The implementation was in C and shell scripts on UNIX. I also provided customer support for CQuest. 
* NewsEdge (acquired by Thomson Business Intelligence) : I analyzed NewsEdge's QA practices and made recommendations for improvement, many of which were implemented. As part of this, I prototyped a test automation tool using Java SE. 
* Arten Technology and Keyport Life Insurance (acquired by Sun Life Financial) : I designed and implemented an application that delivered annuity information to Keyport's customer care representatives, improving their on-the-phone response time. I used Java EE, XML, JAXB, EJB, JBoss, WebLogic, and Oracle. 
* Altisimo Cycling: I conceived, built, and deployed a web-based training log to help competitive cyclists track their training activities. I used JAWS, a Hibernate-like tool for object-relational mapping, and EJB 2.0 container managed persistence of entity beans in JBoss. I used a session bean as a facade over the business layer, and I built a JSP-based MVC framework for the GUI. 
* GaleGroup: I trained staff members on JavaSE and EE, JUnit, servlets, JSP, and EJB. I also designed and implemented tools to help test Gale Group's search-and-delivery system for documents in their publishing catalog, using Java EE, XML, JAXP, EJB, JBoss, and WebLogic. 
* eRoom Technology (acquired by EMC ): In addition to mentoring junior testers, I tested e Room, a web and ActiveX-based groupware application. 
* ProductFactory: I enhanced ProductFactory's web-based project management system, using JavaEE, JSP, WebSphere, and JavaScript. 
* Torch Concepts (formerly Innoverity) : I led the architecture and design of the second version of a web-based system for categorizing and summarizing large sets of documents. Implemented presentation and data layers of the system. Implementation used J2EE, Java, JSP, JAXB, XML, and Resin. 
* GTE Laboratories (merged into Verizon) : I helped build Verizon's web-based billing system using Java EE, servlets, EJB, WebLogic, and a Java-based HTML generator. 
* Enable Rehab: I was Enable's software expert. Using Java SE and Swing, I prototyped a tool to connect a speech recognizer with Knowledge Technology International's mechanical engineering software. 
* ImageConcepts: I helped revive Image Concepts and its product, CQuest. I stabilized the code, fixed bugs, and made enhancements. The implementation used C, Java SE, and AWT on UNIX and Windows.

### CTO, Cofounder -- MobiLingua -- 2004
I designed and built prototypes for an English language learning mobile application. We developed a novel implementation of concatenative speech synthesis in Java ME on Nokia S60, our initial platform.

### Senior Software Engineer, Quality Assurance Manager -- Knowledge Technologies International (formerly ICAD, acquired by Oracle and Dassault Systemes) -- 1992-1997
We built a rules-based programming language and platform to automate mechanical engineering design. The company was founded from an MIT AI project.

## Consulting and Product Development
### Teacher, Coach, Consultant, Keynote Speaker, Author -- Richard Kasperowski | With Great People -- 2013-present
(See description above.)

### Creator -- PianoPlay.app -- 2021-present
I created [PianoPlay.app](https://PianoPlay.app/) to help everyone become the pianist they've always wanted to be. PianoPlay.app uses the pedagogical theory of spaced repetition to help aspiring pianists train themselves to higher levels of musicianship. I implemented PianoPlay.app using Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and S3.

### Creator -- VaccinateAll.org -- 2021-present
[VaccinateAll.org](https://VaccinateAll.org) is a website and social media presence that encourages English and Spanish speakers around the world to vaccinate themselves and their loved ones against Covid. It spreads positive messages to fight against rampant mis- and disinformation. Future iterations of VaccinateAll will generalize the message to promote vaccinations against other preventable infirmities. I publish in Spanish to ensure that the large non-English-speaking community of Spanish speakers receives all the information they need to make informed decisions to vaccinate themselves.

### Creator -- cv-creator -- 2022-present
I created the open source project [cv-creator](https://github.com/rkasper/cv-creator) to make it easy to maintain exactly one version of your curriculum vitae. Write your CV in Markdown, and cv-creator generates a great looking CV in HTML and PDF. The implementation is in Python and CSS. This CV was generated by cv-creator.

### Creator -- SpeakSpanish -- 2021-present
SpeakSpanish is the missing link in foreign language acquisition applications. Its sole purpose is to teach you to speak the language, to pronounce words and phrases correctly. It is designed to be a plug-in component in language acquisition platforms that lack speaking and pronunciation practice (which is almost all of them). Implemented using Python, Flask, and Google Cloud text-to-speech.

### Consultant, Founder -- Altisimo Computing -- 1997-2004
(See description above.)

## Investing and Innovation

### Creator -- VaccinateAll.org -- 2021-present
(See description above.)

### Cofounder -- Greatness Guild -- 2015-present
We wrote the Greatness Manifesto and founded Greatness Guild to help everyone in the world achieve their highest potential.
Version 2 of Greatness Guild will be a registered non-profit aimed at connecting urban young people with great jobs and great health. We plan to run coding dojos to teach programming skills, hosted at the offices of Boston-area tech companies; not only will the kids learn coding skills for well paying jobs, but they'll be connected with the hiring managers in the local tech scene. In addition, we will run a martial arts dojo to help them with physical and mental health.

### Founding Advisor -- Agile Arizona annual conference -- 2016-present
I advised the founders of Agile Arizona on overall conference management, including the importance of insuring diversity, equity, and inclusion in the speaker roster.

I make micro-loans to women in developing countries. As of 2022, I have made 17 loans focusing on issues like food availability and security, potable water, family health, sanitation, education, childbirth and other medical services, entrepreneurship and financial independence, Covid mitigation. I don't care whether borrowers repay me -- the point is to help loan recipients have better lives.

### Lead Mentor, Organizer -- Charles River CoderDojo -- 2014-present
(See description above.)

### President, board member, conference organizer, volunteer -- Agile New England -- 2011-2021
As president and event organizer, I made sure our roster of speakers was at least 50% women. I mentored first-time speakers to help them feel comfortable on stage as they shared amazingly engaging sessions.
