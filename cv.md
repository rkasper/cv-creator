##Teaching and Training
###Instructor -- Harvard University -- 2015-present
I created and teach the course [CSCI E-71/S-71 Agile Software Development](https://agilesoftwarecourse.org). The purpose of the course is to make sure all CS graduates have real-world skills to build and deliver great software products that people love.

Students love the course. In the most recent semester (Fall 2021), students rated the course 4.8 out of 5.0, significantly higher than the mean course review. Sample student reviews include:

* *This is one of the best hands-on courses to learn agile software development. You learn the theory and practice it in a safe environment. This is a "DO NOT MISS THIS" course*
* *This is a great class which includes very helpful, real life examples and talks about real strategies for implementing agile and tackling challenges associated with it. Richard is a great professor with immense knowledge. His style of teaching is wonderful. I loved the class structure. The breakout room activities really help us learn the agile concepts. The final project that we do was a great learning experience as we had to implement agile framework ground up and teaching staff helped us in our way. This is a must course for learning agile practices. A fun course as well.*

I hire and manage my own teaching assistants. To ensure all students feel welcome and can succeed in the course, my teaching assistants are typically women and people of color.

The course itself is an immersive experience in Agile software development. We study the technical, business innovation, and people-dynamics aspects of Agile, including:

* Agility in software product development
* Technical agility, including:
    * Pair programming
    * Mob programming
    * Test-driven development
    * Working with legacy code: refactoring for clean code
    * Behavior-driven development
    * Continuous integration
    * Continuous delivery
    * DevOps
* Business agility, including:
    * Scrum
    * Agile product inception
    * User stories and product backlog construction
    * Definition of done and definition of ready
    * Estimating
    * Agile forecasting and project management
    * Sprint planning
    * Retrospectives
* Advanced agility, including:
    * High-performance teams: Core Protocols for psychological safety and emotional intelligence
    * Agile at large scale
    * Introducing and sustaining Agile in your organization

By the end of the course, students understand Agile software development so thoroughly that they can effectively lead or participate as a member of a great software product development team.
